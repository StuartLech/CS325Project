# News Article Downloader

## Project Overview

This Python script, `my_news_downloader.py`, automates the process of downloading news articles from a list of URLs provided in a text file. It is designed to fetch the content of each URL, specifically targeting the news article itself, while excluding advertisements and other unrelated content. This project can be particularly useful for those looking to perform content analysis on news articles without manually downloading each article.
