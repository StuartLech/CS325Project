Highlights included Dunkin's funny spot with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, BMW's endearing ad with Christopher Walken, and Google Pixel's touching story about someone with limited vision. However, some ads, such as Doritos, Drumstick, and Reese's, failed to impress.</p><h1>Title: "Pop-Tart Wars: Seinfeld Heats Up the Breakfast Battle"</h1><p>Jerry Seinfeld directs and stars in "Unfrosted," a Netflix film about the genesis of the iconic Pop-Tart. The star-studded cast includes Melissa McCarthy, Hugh Grant, and Amy Schumer. The film follows rival cereal companies Kellogg's and Post as they race to create the sugary breakfast treat. Seinfeld remains relevant in breakfast-related entertainment, having often consumed cereal during his "Seinfeld" run and joked about the snack in his 2020 Netflix special. "Unfrosted" streams on May 3.</p><h1>Title: Rebel Moon: The Scargiver - A Visually Epic, But Emotionally Laborious Journey</h1><p>Zack Snyder's "Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver" delivers exciting visuals and a sprawling battle. Despite its tedious preliminaries and derivative plot, the film's warriors remain visually striking. However, the clunky characters and dialogue hinder the emotional impact. Snyder's loyal fan base may appreciate the film's connection to "The Seven Samurai," but its merits suggest Netflix may consider pursuing other projects.</p><h1>Title: Super Bowl LVIII: Harmony and Heat with Reba, Andra, and Post</h1><p>Country star Reba McEntire, R&amp;B singer Andra Day, and rapper Post Malone performed at Super Bowl LVIII. McEntire sang the national anthem, Day sang "Lift Every Voice and Sing," and Malone performed an acoustic version of "America the Beautiful."

Box-office hits "Oppenheimer" and "Barbie" also received significant recognition. Omissions included Margot Robbie for her role in "Barbie" and Greta Gerwig's directing nod for the same film. The nominations acknowledged diversity, with seven actors of color nominated and recognition for elder statesmen such as Scorsese and John Williams. The Oscars will be held on March 10.</p><h1>Title: Ectoplasmic Misstep: "Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire" Chills Without Heart</h1><p>"Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire" returns to New York City, lacking the emotional depth of its predecessor. Despite the presence of original cast members, the film focuses on teen issues and supporting characters, neglecting the senior cast. Bill Murray's brief appearance lacks enthusiasm, and the plot involving an artifact that threatens to freeze the world feels scattered. The film struggles to evoke nostalgia despite callbacks to the original and has an overall mechanical feel.</p><h1>Title: Clash of the Titans: Godzilla and Kong Unite in a Spicy Monster Mashup</h1><p>"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire" brings the Monsterverse a Titan team-up. The film extends the mythology but lacks compelling human characters. Director Adam Wingard treats the story seriously, despite the laughable situations and dialogue. The special effects are impressive, but the Kong rendition remains a flaw. The film will likely appeal to fans invested in the franchise, but falls short of expectations.</p><h1>Title: "Netflix's "Good Times" Reboot: Hot Mess or Cold Comfort?"</h1><p>Netflix's animated "Good Times" reboot loosely connects to the classic sitcom. Despite star-studded producers, the series relies on edgy humor, including drug-dealing babies and gratuitous violence. The show's tenuous connection to the original and lack of distinctive elements raise questions about its purpose, making it an ultimately underwhelming reboot.</p><h1>Title: Psychedelic Phishorium Explodes Vegas with Sensory Overload</h1><p>Phish played four unique shows at Sphere in Las Vegas, featuring trippy visuals on a giant LED screen.
