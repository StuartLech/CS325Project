Title: **Oscars 2024: Spice It Up with Non-English Flicks, Stellar Snubs, and a Pinch of Diversity**

The 2024 Oscar nominations have been revealed, showcasing a global industry with 3 non-English films nominated for Best Picture. Despite blockbuster successes like "Barbie" and "Oppenheimer" receiving nominations, notable omissions include director Greta Gerwig and lead actress Margot Robbie. The Academy recognized some fresh talent with nominations for "American Fiction" and star Greta Lee. Seven actors of color received nominations, including Colman Domingo for "Rustin." Despite the expansion to 10 Best Picture nominees, the disconnect between Best Picture and Best Director remains, with only six films winning the former without a nomination for the latter.
