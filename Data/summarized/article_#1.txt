Title: Super Bowl Ad Wars: Safety First, But Spice it Up for Winners

Super Bowl 2024 ads leaned toward safety, featuring celebrities and familiar products like beer, snacks, cars, and movie trailers. While some outliers stood out, such as Jesus-related ads or Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidential campaign, the overall creative impact was mixed. Winners included Dunkin's Ben Affleck and Matt Damon spot, heartwarming ads from Google Pixel and Kia, and understated pitches from Disney+ and Pfizer. Notable losers included Doritos' violent grannies, Lindt's uninspiring chocolates, and Reese's annoying reactions.
