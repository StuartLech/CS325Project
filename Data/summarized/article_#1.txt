Title: Super Bowl 2024: A Spicy Ad Mix of Celebrities, Humor, and a Few Burnt Wings

Notable highlights included Ben Affleck's Dunkin' ad, Dove's body confidence campaign, and Squarespace's UFO spot. However, some ads fell short, such as Doritos' violent grannies, Drumstick's confusing "Dr. Umstick," and Skechers' overly loud Mr. T rant.
