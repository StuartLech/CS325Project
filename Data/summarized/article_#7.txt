Title: "Good Weed Times: Netflix's Spliff-Smoking Sequel Sparks Controversy"

"Good Times" returns as an animated Netflix series, loosely based on the 1970s sitcom. The series centers on a Black family living in the projects, but the connection to the original is tenuous. It features edgy comedy, talking roaches, and a drug-dealing baby, but critics question the use of the familiar title without a clear purpose.
