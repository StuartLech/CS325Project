Title: "Ghostbusters Reheated: A Chilly Sequel with a Teen Twist"

"Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire" brings back the original cast but lacks the emotional hook of its predecessor. Despite callbacks to the original, the busy movie focuses on teen issues and new characters, leaving the seniors with little to do. The film feels scattered and fails to deliver as a source of nostalgia. Despite a talented cast, "Frozen Empire" comes across as a lukewarm rehash of the concept.
