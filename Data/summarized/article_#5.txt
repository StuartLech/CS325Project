Title: Ectoplasmic Misstep: "Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire" Chills Without Heart

"Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire" returns to New York City, lacking the emotional depth of its predecessor. Despite the presence of original cast members, the film focuses on teen issues and supporting characters, neglecting the senior cast. Bill Murray's brief appearance lacks enthusiasm, and the plot involving an artifact that threatens to freeze the world feels scattered. The film struggles to evoke nostalgia despite callbacks to the original and has an overall mechanical feel.
