Title: "Ghostbusters: Frozen in Mediocrity: When Nostalgia Fails to Warm the Sequel"

"Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire" brings the action back to NYC with original cast members, but lacks the emotional hook of its predecessor. The movie focuses on teen issues and new supporting players, leaving the senior class with little to do. Despite callbacks to the original, "Frozen Empire" feels mechanical and sleepwalks through the old neighborhood.
