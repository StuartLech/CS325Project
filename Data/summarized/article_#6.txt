Title: Clash of the Titans: Godzilla and Kong Unite in a Spicy Monster Mashup

"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire" brings the Monsterverse a Titan team-up. The film extends the mythology but lacks compelling human characters. Director Adam Wingard treats the story seriously, despite the laughable situations and dialogue. The special effects are impressive, but the Kong rendition remains a flaw. The film will likely appeal to fans invested in the franchise, but falls short of expectations.
