Title: Clash of the Titans: Godzilla and Kong's Epic Battle for Supremacy

"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire" extends the Monsterverse with a Titan team-up. Despite the gigantic mayhem, the human characters are inconsequential, and the mythology has become dense. The special effects are impressive, but the film's focus on the battles over plot dilutes the sequel's impact.
