Notable highlights included Ben Affleck's Dunkin' ad, Dove's body confidence campaign, and Squarespace's UFO spot. However, some ads fell short, such as Doritos' violent grannies, Drumstick's confusing "Dr. Umstick," and Skechers' overly loud Mr. T rant.</p><h1>Title: "Pop-Tarts: The Hot and Buttery Rivalry That Set the Breakfast Table Ablaze"</h1><p>Jerry Seinfeld's upcoming Netflix film, "Unfrosted: The Pop-Tart Story," traces the origins of the iconic breakfast item.

Despite a talented cast, "Frozen Empire" comes across as a lukewarm rehash of the concept.</p><h1>Title: Clash of the Titans: Godzilla and Kong's Epic Battle for Supremacy</h1><p>"Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire" extends the Monsterverse with a Titan team-up.
